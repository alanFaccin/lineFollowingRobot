# Every thing about Arduino based Line-Follower-Robot (LFR)


>## Steps To Make a Line Follower Robot (LFR)
  
  
  
>#### Precautions !!!
> DON'T connect the battery, right now.
> `NEVER EVER CONNECT` wires with wrong polarity(ground with live or vice versa)

#### 1. Making the Body
    - Shape the body
    - Mount The motors
    - Connect Motor to motor Driver to Arduino
    - Arrange and add sensors to Board
    - Connect the Jumper wires from sensors to Arduino
#### 2. Checking Connections
    - All the grounds should be connected
    - Check individually that everything works
    - connect the motor with battery whether it is running or not.
    - power up tcrt sensors and take a camera in front of TCRT if it is showing violet lights.
#### 3. Coding 
    - Upload a Simple code to check Arduino
    - check simple TCRT Codes
    - Run motors in different directions.
    - Now upload the justLineFollowWithPID.ino and tune up the PID constants.
